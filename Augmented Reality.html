            <h4>What is  Augmented Reality</h4>
            
            <p>Augmented reality (AR) is an enhanced version of the real physical world that is achieved through the use of digital visual elements, sound, or other sensory stimuli and delivered via technology. It is a growing trend among companies involved in mobile computing and business applications in particular.</p>
            
            <h4> How it works</h4>
            
            <p>Augmented reality starts with a camera-equipped device—such as a smartphone, a tablet, or smart glasses—loaded with AR software. When a user points the device and looks at an object, the software recognizes it through computer vision technology, which analyzes the video stream.
<br><br>
The device then downloads information about the object from the cloud, in much the same way that a web browser loads a page via a URL. A fundamental difference is that the AR information is presented in a 3-D “experience” superimposed on the object rather than in a 2-D page on a screen. What the user sees, then, is part real and part digital.
<br><br>
A 3-D digital model that resides in the cloud—the object’s “digital twin”—serves as the bridge between the smart object and the AR. This model is created either by using computer-aided design, usually during product development, or by using technology that digitizes physical objects. The twin then collects information from the product, business systems, and external sources to reflect the product’s current reality. It is the vehicle through which the AR software accurately places and scales up-to-date information on the object.
</p>
            <h4>Importance of AR</h4>
             
             <p>AR increases engagement and interaction and provides a richer user experience. Research has shown that AR increases the perceived value of products and brands. Well-implemented AR activity conveys innovation and responsiveness from forward-thinking brands.</p>
