            <h4>What is  Mixed Reality</h4>
            
            <p>Mixed reality is a blend of physical and digital worlds, unlocking natural and intuitive 3D human, computer, and environmental interactions. This new reality is based on advancements in computer vision, graphical processing, display technologies, input systems, and cloud computing.</p>
            
            <h4> How it works</h4>
            
            <p>Mixed reality works with the help of cloud computing and artificial intelligence. An MR device processes and stores data in three axes or dimensions using powerful AI sensors, lenses, a graphical processing unit (GPU), as well as graphic cards or core chips. The more a device’s capabilities, the greater the mixed reality experiences. Examples include intelligent eyewear, gloves, bodysuits, and smartphones.
<br><br>
MR devices may link consumers to a wireless or wired computer, console, or PC to access software. The program may add, duplicate, or relocate virtual items to create immersive environments. Modern mixed reality headsets, such as Hololens, generate high-fidelity settings to engage users in virtual activities, thus erasing the boundaries and separating reality and technology.
</p>
            <h4>Importance of MR</h4>
             
             <p>Mixed reality is a breakthrough development, adding convenience to a tech that already exists by making access small and by entirely changing how we communicate with the real-life environments around us. It is possible to create new interactivity and entrance in all of our processes by blending both the digital and physical worlds. In the context of only entertainment, the potential of mixed reality innovation is virtually infinite.</p>
