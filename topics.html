        <h3>Computer Vision</h3>
        <p>Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers and systems to derive meaningful information from digital images, videos and other visual inputs — and take actions or make recommendations based on that information. If AI enables computers to think, computer vision enables them to see, observe and understand.</p>

        <h3>Additive Manufacturing</h3>
        <p>Additive manufacturing, also known as 3D printing, is a process of creating three-dimensional objects by adding layer upon layer of material until the desired shape is achieved. It offers advantages over traditional manufacturing methods, such as the ability to create complex shapes and reduce material waste. It has applications in a variety of industries and has the potential to transform the way we manufacture products.</p>
