            <h4>What is  Computer Vision</h4>
            
            <p>Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers and systems to derive meaningful information from digital images, videos and other visual inputs — and take actions or make recommendations based on that information. If AI enables computers to think, computer vision enables them to see, observe and understand.
<br><br>
Computer vision works much the same as human vision, except humans have a head start. Human sight has the advantage of lifetimes of context to train how to tell objects apart, how far away they are, whether they are moving and whether there is something wrong in an image.
<br><br>
Computer vision trains machines to perform these functions, but it has to do it in much less time with cameras, data and algorithms rather than retinas, optic nerves and a visual cortex. Because a system trained to inspect products or watch a production asset can analyze thousands of products or processes a minute, noticing imperceptible defects or issues, it can quickly surpass human capabilities.

</p>
            
            <h4> How it works</h4>
            
            <p>Computer vision needs lots of data. It runs analyses of data over and over until it discerns distinctions and ultimately recognize images. For example, to train a computer to recognize automobile tires, it needs to be fed vast quantities of tire images and tire-related items to learn the differences and recognize a tire, especially one with no defects.
<br><br>
Two essential technologies are used to accomplish this: a type of machine learning called deep learning and a convolutional neural network (CNN).
<br><br>
Machine learning uses algorithmic models that enable a computer to teach itself about the context of visual data. If enough data is fed through the model, the computer will “look” at the data and teach itself to tell one image from another. Algorithms enable the machine to learn by itself, rather than someone programming it to recognize an image.
<br><br>
A CNN helps a machine learning or deep learning model “look” by breaking images down into pixels that are given tags or labels. It uses the labels to perform convolutions (a mathematical operation on two functions to produce a third function) and makes predictions about what it is “seeing.” The neural network runs convolutions and checks the accuracy of its predictions in a series of iterations until the predictions start to come true. It is then recognizing or seeing images in a way similar to humans.
<br><br>
Much like a human making out an image at a distance, a CNN first discerns hard edges and simple shapes, then fills in information as it runs iterations of its predictions. A CNN is used to understand single images. A recurrent neural network (RNN) is used in a similar way for video applications to help computers understand how pictures in a series of frames are related to one another.
</p>
            <h4>Importance of Computer Vision</h4>
             
             <p>There is a lot of research being done in the computer vision field, but it’s not just research. Real-world applications demonstrate how important computer vision is to endeavors in business, entertainment, transportation, healthcare and everyday life. A key driver for the growth of these applications is the flood of visual information flowing from smartphones, security systems, traffic cameras and other visually instrumented devices. This data could play a major role in operations across industries, but today goes unused. The information creates a test bed to train computer vision applications and a launchpad for them to become part of a range of human activities.</p>

                <li>IBM used computer vision to create My Moments for the 2018 Masters golf tournament. IBM Watson watched hundreds of hours of Masters footage and could identify the sights (and sounds) of significant shots. It curated these key moments and delivered them to fans as personalized highlight reels.                </li><br>
                <li>Google Translate lets users point a smartphone camera at a sign in another language and almost immediately obtain a translation of the sign in their preferred language.
</li><br>
                <li>The development of self-driving vehicles relies on computer vision to make sense of the visual input from a car’s cameras and other sensors. It’s essential to identify other cars, traffic signs, lane markers, pedestrians, bicycles and all of the other visual information encountered on the road.

                <li>IBM is applying computer vision technology with partners like Verizon to bring intelligent AI to the edge, and to help automotive manufacturers identify quality defects before a vehicle leaves the factory.</li>
